## Usage

Once the application is running, navigate to the frontend URL. You will see a login page. If you are a new user, you can register by clicking the "Sign Up" button. After logging in, you can create new notes, view existing ones, edit, or delete them.

## Authentication

iNotebook uses JWT for user authentication. When a user logs in, a token is generated and stored in local storage. This token is sent with every request to secure the API endpoints.

### Registration

New users can register by filling out the registration form. Once registered, you can log in using your new credentials.

## CRUD Operations

iNotebook supports full CRUD operations for notes. This means you can create new notes, read existing notes, update them, and delete them as needed. Each operation is straightforward and user-friendly.

### Create

Creating a note involves filling out a form with a title and content. Once saved, the note will appear in your list.

Editing a note is as simple as clicking on it, making changes, and saving.
